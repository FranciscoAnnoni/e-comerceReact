# ‚è∞ Empressaria
Empressaria is an e-commerce website designed to facilitate product browsing in a simple and efficient way. This project displays a product list stored in a JSON file, dynamically queried to extract information and display images for each product, without needing a database connection. It is an ideal project to showcase a static and functional product catalog.

## Features
Product Catalog: A product list loaded from a JSON file, allowing for quick updates and management.
Image Display: Each product includes an associated image stored locally or accessible by URL.
Routing System: A router implementation manages the routes (/) for each section of the menu, enabling smooth navigation between different parts of the page.
Modular Code: JavaScript modules are used for continuous code reuse, making maintenance and future extensions easier.
Simple and Responsive Design: The interface is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, providing a user-friendly experience on both computers and mobile devices.

## Requirements
To use or modify Empressaria, a modern web browser that supports JavaScript and ES6 modules is required.

## Future Improvements
Potential future improvements include:

## Adding shopping cart functionality.
Integrating a database to manage larger volumes of products.
Implementing a payment gateway.
Accessibility enhancements and interface design improvements.
